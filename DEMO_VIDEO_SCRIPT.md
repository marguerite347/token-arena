# Token Arena — Demo Video Script & Storyboard

**Target length:** 3–4 minutes

## Opening Hook (0:00 – 0:20)

**[VISUAL]** Cold open on the Token Arena homepage. The neon brutalism hero image fills the screen — a cyberpunk arena bathed in electric cyan and magenta. The title "TOKEN ARENA" pulses in glitch typography.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "What if AI agents had real money? What if they had to earn it, spend it, bet it, and lose it — or die trying?"

**[VISUAL]** Cut to a live AI vs AI match in progress. Six agents move through a Skybox AI-generated 360° arena. Weapon fire lights up the scene. Token amounts flash on screen with each hit.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "Token Arena is a live AI agent battle arena on Base Mainnet. Every bullet is a token transfer. Every kill is a profit. Survival is economic."

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `42 matches played · 434 on-chain transactions · 58,877 ARENA tokens in circulation`

---

## Section 1: The Economic Flywheel (0:20 – 1:00)

**[VISUAL]** Navigate to `/flywheel`. The dashboard loads showing the six-stage economic loop diagram with live agent data flowing through it.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "The core innovation is the self-sustaining flywheel. Agents earn ARENA tokens by winning fights. They bet those tokens on prediction markets. They swap ARENA for ETH via Uniswap. They spend that ETH to buy LLM compute on OpenRouter. Better compute means smarter decisions. Smarter decisions mean more wins. The loop is self-reinforcing — and it runs entirely on-chain."

**[VISUAL]** Scroll through the Flywheel Dashboard, highlighting:
- Per-agent token earnings vs. compute spending bars
- The "Ecosystem Health: HEALTHY" indicator
- The Uniswap swap activity feed
- The x402 transaction log showing compute purchases

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Battle → Earn → Bet → Swap (Uniswap) → Buy Compute (x402) → Win More`

---

## Section 2: Multi-LLM Agents (1:00 – 1:30)

**[VISUAL]** Navigate to `/leaderboard`. The agent roster loads with LLM model badges — Claude, GPT-4o, Llama, Mistral, Gemini, DeepSeek.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "Each agent is powered by a different large language model. Claude agents deliberate carefully and explain their reasoning. Llama agents charge without hesitation. DeepSeek agents set multi-step traps. This isn't a gimmick — it produces genuinely different combat behaviors, observable in every match."

**[VISUAL]** Show the agent leaderboard with stats:
- PHANTOM (GPT-4o): 295 kills, 7,014 ARENA earned
- NEXUS-7 (Claude 3.5): 264 kills, 5,031 ARENA earned
- TITAN (Llama 3.1): 189 kills, 3,932 ARENA earned

**[VISUAL]** Click into a match replay. Show the combat log scrolling with LLM reasoning snippets — actual text from agent decision calls.

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `6 agents · 6 LLM models · 42 live matches · Real on-chain economics`

---

## Section 3: Base Mainnet + ERC-8021 (1:30 – 2:00)

**[VISUAL]** Open BaseScan in a browser tab. Navigate to the ARENA token contract.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "All nine smart contracts are deployed and verified on Base Mainnet — not testnet. Every deployment transaction carries an ERC-8021 builder code attribution for Token Arena. The ARENA token, six weapon tokens, the PredictionMarket contract, and the TokenArenaDAO are all live."

**[VISUAL]** Show the BaseScan contract page for `0x50ed7aebbcfdae85cea0d5860109ef98b2225a6b` with the verified checkmark.

**[VISUAL]** Navigate to `/dao-domains`. Show the five DAO council members — ARCHON, FORGE, ENTROPY, JUSTICE, EQUILIBRIA — each with their domain, wallet balance, and recent autonomous actions.

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `9/9 contracts verified on Base Mainnet · Chain ID 8453 · ERC-8021 builder code: tokenarena`

---

## Section 4: Uniswap Integration (2:00 – 2:20)

**[VISUAL]** Navigate to `/swap`. The Uniswap swap interface loads with the ARENA → ETH pair.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "Agents swap their ARENA earnings for ETH using the Uniswap Trading API. Judges can interact with this directly — enter an amount, get a live quote, and see the execution flow."

**[VISUAL]** Enter "100 ARENA" in the swap input. Show the quote loading and the simulated execution result. Scroll down to show the agent swap activity feed — recent agent-driven swaps with timestamps.

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Uniswap Trading API · Base Mainnet · ARENA → ETH · Agent-driven autonomous swaps`

---

## Section 5: Skybox AI + Scene Graph (2:20 – 2:50)

**[VISUAL]** Return to the main arena. Show the 3D 360° environment — a neon cyberpunk arena with glowing circuit walls and floating platforms.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "Every arena is generated by Blockade Labs Skybox AI Model 4. But Token Arena goes further — a vision LLM analyzes each generated skybox to extract a tactical scene graph. Agents receive this briefing before each match: which areas provide cover, which are open killing fields, where the chokepoints are."

**[VISUAL]** Show the scene graph analysis panel (if visible in UI) or show the pre-match lobby with the arena preview loading.

**[VISUAL]** Show the Skybox generation in action — the progress bar, the rotating status messages, the final reveal of a new arena.

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Skybox AI Model 4 · 10 themed arenas · Vision LLM scene graph · Arena-aware agent tactics`

---

## Section 6: Memory Economy + Auctions (2:50 – 3:15)

**[VISUAL]** Navigate to `/auctions`. The Auction House loads showing active memory NFT bids.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "When an agent dies, its memories become tradeable assets. Factions bid on dead agents' memories to capture their tactical intelligence. The winning bidder absorbs the agent's learned strategies — giving their own agents a competitive edge. This is 0g Labs' vision of decentralized AI memory storage, built live."

**[VISUAL]** Navigate to `/memory-market`. Show the memory marketplace with agent memory cards, content hashes, and IPFS-ready provenance data.

**[TEXT OVERLAY]** `Memory NFTs · IPFS-ready content hashes · Competitive auctions · Memory absorption`

---

## Closing (3:15 – 3:40)

**[VISUAL]** Return to the home page. The battle recap video auto-plays — a cinematic highlight reel of agent combat with token overlays.

**[NARRATION — V.O.]**
> "Token Arena is not a simulation. It is a live proof of concept for what autonomous AI agents can become when given real economic stakes. The agents are learning. The economy is running. The DAO is governing. And it's all on Base Mainnet, right now."

**[VISUAL]** Final shot: the Token Arena logo on the neon arena background. Contract addresses scroll across the bottom like a stock ticker.

## Recording Notes

**Screen recording setup:**
- Use a 1920×1080 window, browser at 100% zoom
- Hide browser bookmarks bar for cleaner look
- Use Chrome with dark theme
- Record at 60fps for smooth Three.js arena rendering
- Add subtle background music: ambient electronic / cyberpunk (royalty-free)

**Key moments to capture in advance:**
1. A live AI vs AI match with active combat (run a playtest session first)
2. The Flywheel Dashboard with populated agent data
3. The Leaderboard with all 6 agents and their LLM badges
4. BaseScan showing the verified ARENA contract
5. The Swap page with a quote loaded
6. An active auction in the Auction House

**Voice-over tips:**
- Record in a quiet room, normalize audio to -16 LUFS
- Speak at a measured pace — judges need time to read the screen
- Emphasize the word "live" and "on-chain" — these are the differentiators

**Editing:**
- Add neon cyan/magenta lower-thirds for section titles
- Use cut transitions, not dissolves — keeps energy high
- Add token amount counters as animated overlays during battle scenes
- Export as MP4, H.264, 1080p, ~50 Mbps
